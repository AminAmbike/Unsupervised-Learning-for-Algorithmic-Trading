This analysis demonstrates the potential of technical analysis and momentum-based investing strategies, such as those leveraging the Relative Strength Index (RSI), to outperform benchmarks like the S&P 500. While this approach showed significant success over the past 7 years with a return of nearly 200%, it is important to recognize the challenges of sustaining such performance over longer periods.

As market conditions change, even the largest hedge funds, with vast resources and sophisticated strategies, often struggle to consistently beat the market. Therefore, while momentum strategies can generate large returns in the short to medium term, long-term success requires continuous adaptation and risk management.
